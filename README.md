## What's this?

A browser-agnostic flexbox component with CSS gap polyfill support. Uses feature detection to ensure consistent rendering across platforms.

## Why should I use this package?

There are 3 main reasons to use this package compared to other similar packages in the ecosystem.

1. **Simplicity**: This package provides only a single component called `Flex` which renders a single DOM element with flexbox. This allows users to compose however many layers of flexboxes they want. This package also keeps the props of the component simple and straightforward.
2. **Flexibility**: This package neither assumes any responsive design logic nor hardcodes measurements. This allows users to provide these values when using the component making it usable in all scenarios.
3. **Compatibility**: This package supports browsers that do not support `gap` CSS property by using `margin` CSS properties and custom calculation logic. This allows users to fearlessly use the flexbox grid design everywhere.

## What CSS-in-JS library does this package use?

While we do use [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/), we are open to any contributions that makes this package independent of styling libraries.

## How do I use it?

Simply import it and use it as any regular component.

```tsx
import Flex from '@qatalog/react-flex';

const Button = ({}) => {
  return (
    <Flex direction="row" alignItems="center" wrap="wrap" gap={8}>
      <div>One</div>
      <div>Two</div>
    </Flex>
  );
};

export default Button;
```
